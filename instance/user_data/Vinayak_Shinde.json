    "wellness_report": "Okay, let's review your assessment! It's really thoughtful of you to answer all these questions so openly and honestly.  Based on your responses, it looks like you're going through a period where you're feeling quite overwhelmed and dealing with a lot. It takes courage to acknowledge that things are tough, and you've done just that.  Let's break down the feedback in a friendly way, just like colleagues discussing how to make things even better.\n\n**Summary of Feedback:**\n\nYou've created a really comprehensive set of questions that touch upon many important areas of mental health.  Your direct, close-ended questions are great for quickly identifying potential concerns.  The honesty in your answers is also really valuable and shows a good level of self-awareness.\n\nHowever, to make the assessment even more insightful, we could refine some questions to be more specific and consider adding a few more open-ended follow-ups, especially when you answer \"yes\" to certain questions. This would help in understanding the nuances of your experiences better.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Your questions really do cover a wide range of mental health symptoms and experiences. You've touched upon areas like mood, thoughts, perception, memory, and even coping mechanisms. This broad approach is excellent for getting a holistic view.\n* **Directness of Close-Ended Questions:**  The \"yes/no\" questions are clear and direct, making it easy to quickly identify areas that might need further exploration.  This is efficient for an initial screening.\n* **Honest Self-Reflection:** Your answers are very honest, which is a significant strength.  Being truthful with yourself is the first step towards understanding and addressing any challenges.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* **Specificity in Questions:** Some of the close-ended questions are quite broad. For example, \"Do you feel overwhelmed or anxious?\" is a good starting point, but specifying *what* you feel overwhelmed or anxious *about* could provide more targeted information.  Think about adding context where relevant.\n* **Follow-up on \"Yes\" Answers:**  When you answer \"yes\" to a question indicating a potential difficulty (like \"hearing voices\" or \"feeling overwhelmed by emotions\"), having a brief, open-ended follow-up question could be really beneficial.  This would allow you to elaborate and give more detail, going beyond just a \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n**Bhagavad Gita Insight:**\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, in verse 2.47, talks about focusing on the present moment.  It's like saying, \"Hey, let's deal with what's right here, right now.\"  When we feel overwhelmed or scattered, like maybe you are feeling right now with some of these experiences, bringing our attention to the present can be incredibly helpful.  For your assessment, this means making sure the questions are focused on current symptoms or recent experiences.  This \"present moment focus\" can bring more clarity and less confusion, both in answering questions about yourself and in designing them for others.\n\n**Actionable Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Rephrase for Clarity and Specificity:**  Go through your close-ended questions and see where you can add a bit more detail. For instance, instead of \"Have you noticed any changes in your eating habits?\", you could ask, \"Have you noticed you're eating significantly more or less than usual lately?\" or \"Have you been eating for emotional reasons?\".\n2. **Incorporate Open-Ended Follow-ups:**  For questions where a \"yes\" answer suggests a potential issue, add a simple follow-up like: \"If yes, can you tell me a little more about that?\" or \"Could you describe what that feels like for you?\". This encourages deeper reflection.\n3. **Practice 5-Minute Daily Meditation:**  Just like focusing on the present moment is helpful in understanding your experiences, meditation can train your mind to stay more present and calm. Try starting with just 5 minutes each day. You can focus on your breath, and if thoughts come, gently guide your attention back to your breath. This aligns with the Gita's idea of self-discipline for mental well-being.\n4. **Incorporate Exercise:**  Even a short 20-minute walk each day can make a difference in how you feel emotionally and physically.  Physical activity is a great way to reduce stress and boost your mood naturally. Think of it as a way to recharge both your mind and body.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYou've made a fantastic start with your assessment! It's already quite comprehensive and insightful. With a few tweaks to add specificity and open-ended follow-ups, it can become even more powerful.  Remember, just like refining these questions, taking care of your mental well-being is also a process. Be kind to yourself, keep practicing self-reflection, and consider incorporating meditation and exercise into your routine.  If you want to explore any of these points further or have more questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  You're doing great work!"
