## 🌟 Overview

**Chikitsa Lite** is a revolutionary, privacy-preserving mental health platform that democratizes access to psychological support through cutting-edge AI technology. Built as an evolution of our original Chikitsa project, this application combines gamified assessments, multilingual chatbot support, multimodal behavioral analysis, and secure on-device processing to address the global mental health crisis.

**Chikitsa** addresses the fundamental challenge in mental health assessment: **users can lie during questionnaires and chatbot interactions, but behavioral patterns don't lie**. Our platform captures authentic psychological insights through:

- **🎮 Gamified Cognitive Tests**: Users play only once per day, recording genuine behavioral responses
- **🎥 Multimodal Analysis**: Video/audio recording during gameplay for comprehensive behavioral assessment
- **🎭 Emotion Detection**: Real-time facial emotion analysis to eliminate AI hallucinations and provide context-aware responses
- **🧠 Authentic Assessment**: Like real psychiatrists, we analyze micro-expressions, reaction patterns, and involuntary responses

### 🌍 Global Impact
- **970 million** people globally affected by mental health disorders
- **170,000+** mental health incidents reported in India (2022)
- **$37B** Total Addressable Market in India
- **$77B** Global market opportunity

### 🎥 Multimodal Integration

```python
# Emotion detection and behavioral analysis
def analyze_user_behavior(video_path, audio_path):
    """
    Comprehensive behavioral analysis from recorded gameplay
    """
    emotion_results = detect_facial_emotions(video_path)
    voice_analysis = analyze_voice_patterns(audio_path)
    
    behavioral_score = {
        'emotional_stability': calculate_emotion_variance(emotion_results),
        'stress_indicators': detect_stress_markers(voice_analysis),
        'authenticity_score': validate_emotional_consistency(emotion_results),
        'micro_expression_patterns': analyze_micro_expressions(video_path)
    }
